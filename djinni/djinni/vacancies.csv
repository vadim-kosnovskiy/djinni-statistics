The goal of creating a smart city is to improve the quality of life using urban informatics technology to improve service efficiency and meet the needs of residents. The main goal is access to counters and other city systems from the phone.,The world is changing, and we must adapt! In the last few years, utility industries have started renovating to adapt to forever increasing needs of water, electricity, and other resources by introducing smart city functions at a global scale. We are trying to further this change with our platform.,We are putting all our efforts into perfecting water usage functionality by implementing various monitoring and alerting tools for our customers. To do this we try to utilize the best-suited technologies for it and use all our previous experience to create a platform that would monitor over 20 million devices hourly.,Under secure requirements, it is obligatory to have AWS Certificate or Azure Cloud Certificate, or Google Cloud Certificate (existing or expired at least).,We are looking for engineers, who are willing to experiment, learn new skills, and new ways of approaching interesting and complex tasks.,We value people:,‚Äì who are keen to express themselves, even if it might not be a popular opinion;,‚Äì who are enthusiastic about saving natural resources from depletion by helping us with our mission;,‚Äì who are willing to work on a large-scale project with a quite big range of functionality;,‚Äì who puts team effort higher than personal gain;,‚Äì who values quality over quantity.,Stack:,‚Äì 4 + years experience with Python;,‚Äì Lambdas (where most of our code sits);,‚Äì Terraform (where all our configuration sits);,‚Äì Redshift / DynamoDB / Athena / S3(Data-lake) (where all our data sits);,‚Äì SQS / SNS / API-GW (how we are communicating inside the platform);,‚Äì Amazon Kinesis / Glue / Spark (how we are transforming incoming data).,Other technologies/services/frameworks we are using:,‚Äì Cognito;,‚Äì Quicksight;,‚Äì PowerBI;,‚Äì React(for frontend app);,‚Äì Kibana stack;,‚Äì CircleCI;,‚Äì Redis.,We offer:,1. 24 calendar days of paid vacation per year (after trial period);,2.

This translates to long wait times and extremely high stress for employees. Currently, the restaurants are experiencing a major hiring crisis due to this extreme stress and increasing minimum wage.,Most quick-service restaurants had begun to search for a more elegant solution that improves customer experience, increases speed, accuracy, average ticket size, and reduces employee stress.,Our AI greets the customer, takes the order, and inserts it into the point of sale freeing up the employees to focus on other tasks.,Understanding an order in the drive-thru using voice is not an easy task and requires deep technology to get to the required high completion rate of orders. The challenges include a very noisy environment, unique speech patterns due to the customer's indecisiveness, different accents, gender, ages, speech from other people in the car, complex multi-turn unstructured conversation, low latency, and more. In order to solve big challenges, we are developing our own speech and natural language understanding tech from the ground up.,We are a group of experts in Speech, NLU, and Backend SW. We strongly believe in impact-driven employment where you can work from wherever you're most comfortable and effective. Because of the myriad of challenges and the fast pace, each team member gets to experience a lot of professional growth and ownership.,About the Role & Responsibilities:,- Our backend is developed all in Python running in the cloud over k8s.,- It's not a typical backend interacting with a UI frontend. It handles audio streams in real-time and runs our key AI algorithms.,- The role involves designing and implementing complex parts of the backend. This involves distributed architecture as well as concurrency while taking into consideration performance and scale.,Requirements,- 5+ years experience in Python,- Experience in SW design and backend dev,- Developed and deployed multiple projects used in production,- Experience with Docker, Kubernetes, Microservices, CI/CD, Clouds (AWS/GCP/Azure),- experience with async IO, threading, or concurrent programming,- deep control of Python 3 and its standard library.,Preferred Qualifications:,- Experience with real-time audio processing,Join us to be a part of an amazing team with great vibes, a company with a lot of freedom of movement, interesting and unique challenges, and an opportunity to influence and build something big."

We‚Äôve got a production grade codebase that we want to reuse to build a new product. Now we need a team of makers. This role is a core person in that team.,The challenging part is that our current code has been written on Ruby on Rails. We want to launch a new product reusing most of that. However we‚Äôd like to develop a missing functionality with a Python.,So this role assumes understanding of Ruby and being able to provide critical fixes to a RoR solution if needed.,# Responsibilities,- Take ownership of the existing production grade code base,- Develop new features,- Follow and improve the development process,- Make sure that the technology stack is up to date,- Mentor the teammates,# Our Stack,- Python, Ruby on Rails,- Rest API, WebSockets,- AWS, k8s,- PostgresSQL, Elasticsearch, Redis,- Location Services (Google and others),* Why should you join us?,- You will be part of a team that creates innovative and useful products.,- We prefer remote work, not a shiny office with a 9-18 schedule. We have a full remote without time trackers.,- We value asynchronous communication instead of long exhausting meetings.,- We value openness and transparency in the team.,- We always strive to be on the cutting edge of technology and use the best tools for the job.,- We don't like to repeat ourselves, so we automate everything.,- We prefer to use industry proven available tools and services instead of building the custom solutions.,* What we offer:,- Equipment and Devices: Don‚Äôt have a laptop? No problem, we'll give it to you. Or do you prefer to work on your lovely personal computer? That's ok with us as well.,- Probation Period: Up to 3 month, it depends on your progress.,- Work Schedule: You are free to plan your working day as you want.,- Vacation: 24 calendar days + public holidays.,- Sick Days: 5 days per year without a doctor‚Äôs note."
